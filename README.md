As you may see, there is a minimul ui

Part of work what was interesting for me is released -- registration, starting/carring out/finishing game(and generally back-end) is completed and even seems to be usable without major bugs

Honestly say, there is not much work left, i think for about one week

Maybe, in future i'll even finish it

UPD: Okay, i found a bug, amazon didnot download at least one script(for signing up), so you cant registrate

    I'll see, if i can remember verification data to fix it

    For now, if someone needs you can use login/password: nokia5/nokia5
    Or replace "5" by any number between 1 and, i think, 13
